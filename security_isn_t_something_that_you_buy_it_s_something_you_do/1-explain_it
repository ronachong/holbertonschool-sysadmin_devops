1. To access the sandbox servers remotely, you should create a pair of keys, one public and one private. The bash command ssh-keygen is to be used for this.
2 & 3. The public and private keys will be used for authentication of your identity when you try to access one of the servers. Using the command ssh-copy-id, you can send the public key to the remote  server. The public key can only be decrypted by the private key with which it was generated, so when you attempt to connect to the server, the public key will be matched to the private key on your local computer to verify your identity.
